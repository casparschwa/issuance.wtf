# Introduction

Ethereum's issuance policy is effective at ensuring a minimum level of staking and thereby economically guaranteeing reasonable security.

However, the current issuance policy has effectively no control over the upper limit of stake participation. A too high staking ratio, (staked ETH / total ETH), comes with downsides that need to be considered carefully.

For this reason, proposals to change Ethereum's issuance policy were put forward and are currently discussed.

The goal of this document is to collect resources (writeups/talks/podcasts/etc.) relevant to Ethereum's *current* issuance discussion.

# Highlights
*Disclaimer: This section is <u>subjective</u>. Please take a look at the following section for a more exhaustive and unopinionated list of resources.*

For an overview on the current issuance debate, the following resources are a good starting point; in \~rough\~ order of suggested consumption:

### Technical highlights (> ðŸ¤¯)
1. [Ansgar](https://twitter.com/adietrichs) & [Caspar's](https://twitter.com/casparschwa) [issuance endgameâ„¢ post](https://ethresear.ch/t/endgame-staking-economics-a-case-for-targeting/18751) explores why Ethereum is plausibly heading towards a very high % stake evnvironment under its current issuance policy; it then argues for why this future is problematic, and suggests to *target* a low staking ratio in the issuance endgame. Alternatively, watch this talk by same authors focuses on *why* to change the issuance policy: ["Is Ethereumâ€™s Issuance Policy Sustainable?"](https://ethcc.io/archive/Is-Ethereums-Issuance-Policy-Sustainable) focuses on *why* to change the issuance policy, i.e. problems of high % staked environments.
3. [Anders'](https://twitter.com/weboftrees) [master piece](https://ethresear.ch/t/properties-of-issuance-level-consensus-incentives-and-variability-across-potential-reward-curves/18448/) proposes and analyzes new reward curve(s) with tempered issuance. Beyond the specific curve(s), it is a valuable resource to learn about relevant properties when considering issuance curves. Note that in broad strokes, Anders considers this proposed issuance policy to be viable for the endgame, while Ansgar&Caspar consider it a great *short term* issuance policy before moving to a stake ratio targeting policy for the endgame. 
4. [Mike's](https://twitter.com/mikeneuder) [second Issuance Issues](https://notes.ethereum.org/@mikeneuder/subsol) takes the time it deserves to provide more intuition for a key point of the issuance endgameâ„¢ post: why *real* issuance yield can be higher in the long term equilibrium, despite a reduced (!) issuance policy.
5. [Anders'](https://twitter.com/weboftrees) deep-dive on his [thinking about the trade-offs](https://ethresear.ch/t/faq-ethereum-issuance-reduction/19675) when exploring various potential issuance policies in an FAQ format. Note that Anders' views differ to Ansgar&Caspar's in <u>some</u> aspects, e.g. desirable staking ratio target or viability of non-targeting policies for the endgame. 
6. If you prefer podcast format, this [Uncommon Core episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2YhHNjUwj44F1C3LXcCP0N?si=YmbgzZwcRTqaYVct6AzkfA) (also on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivynR3RI3_Y)) is your 2.5h one-stop solution. It outlines most of [Ansgar](https://twitter.com/adietrichs) & [Caspar's](https://twitter.com/casparschwa) thinking behind the issuance endgameâ„¢ post + productive debate with Hasu&Jon.

### High-level highlights (= ðŸ¤¯)
1. [Ansgar](https://twitter.com/adietrichs)&[Caspar](https://twitter.com/casparschwa)'s talk ["Is Ethereumâ€™s Issuance Policy Sustainable?"](https://ethcc.io/archive/Is-Ethereums-Issuance-Policy-Sustainable) focuses on *why* to change the issuance policy, i.e. problems of high % staked environments.
2. [Mike's](https://twitter.com/mikeneuder) [Initial Issue](https://notes.ethereum.org/@mikeneuder/iiii) is a more high-level take on the endgame postâ„¢ and presents his view on the matter.
3. In this [Bankless episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLP_qRyPuv4) [David](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState) & [Ryan](https://twitter.com/RyanSAdams) "give a masterclass on monetary policy for Ethereum and beyond".
4. In this [Epicenter episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2krlPcbpZvQ) [nixo](https://twitter.com/nixorokish) & [superhiz](https://twitter.com/superphiz) from EthStaker talk about the issuance debate with a focus on the solo staker perspective.
